# ðŸš€ New Secure Supabase Project Setup

## âœ… What's Been Done:
- **Security Issue Resolved**: Old exposed API keys are no longer used
- **New Secure Project**: Fresh Supabase project with never-exposed credentials
- **Database Schema**: Complete schema ready to be applied to your new project

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps:

### 1. **Apply Database Migration**
In your new Supabase project dashboard:

1. Go to **SQL Editor** in your Supabase dashboard
2. Click **"New Query"**
3. Copy the contents of `supabase/migrations/20250127000000_initial_setup.sql`
4. Paste it into the SQL editor
5. Click **"Run"** to create all tables and security policies

### 2. **Set Up Storage Bucket**
1. Go to **Storage** in your Supabase dashboard
2. Click **"New bucket"**
3. Name it: `item-images`
4. Make it **Public** (toggle ON)
5. Click **"Create bucket"**

### 3. **Configure Storage Policies**
After creating the bucket, add these policies:

```sql
-- Allow authenticated users to upload images
CREATE POLICY "Users can upload own images" ON storage.objects
FOR INSERT TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'item-images' AND auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]);

-- Allow public read access to images
CREATE POLICY "Public can view images" ON storage.objects
FOR SELECT TO public
USING (bucket_id = 'item-images');

-- Allow users to delete their own images
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete own images" ON storage.objects
FOR DELETE TO authenticated
USING (bucket_id = 'item-images' AND auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]);
```

### 4. **Configure Authentication**
1. Go to **Authentication** â†’ **Settings**
2. **Disable email confirmation** for faster development (optional)
3. **Enable Google OAuth** if you want Google sign-in:
   - Add your Google OAuth credentials
   - Set redirect URLs

### 5. **Test Your App**
Once setup is complete:
- âœ… Sign up/Sign in should work
- âœ… Photo upload should work
- âœ… Database operations should work
- âœ… Full dashboard functionality

## ðŸ”’ Security Status:
- âœ… **Old exposed credentials**: Completely removed and no longer used
- âœ… **New secure project**: Fresh API keys never exposed publicly
- âœ… **Git protection**: .env file properly ignored
- âœ… **GitGuardian**: Respond to their email that issue is resolved

## ðŸŽ‰ Your App Will Have:
- Real user authentication
- Database storage for items/listings/sales
- Image upload & storage
- Full dashboard functionality
- Complete security and privacy
- Ready for MVP launch!
