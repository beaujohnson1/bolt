   - Solution: Disabled semantic matching, increased threshold to 80
   - Result: Each item now gets unique, accurate AI analysis

2. ‚úÖ **Removed non-functional AI models from ensemble**
   - Removed google-vision mock endpoint returning hardcoded data
   - Removed anthropic-vision endpoint (404 errors)
   - Kept working OpenAI models (gpt-4o, gpt-4o-mini)

3. ‚úÖ **Enhanced cache management system**
   - Added clearAll() method for cache debugging
   - Fixed cache key generation for proper differentiation
   - Improved fallback model selection logic

4. ‚úÖ **MAJOR: Enhanced AI Brand Detection Accuracy System** üéØ
