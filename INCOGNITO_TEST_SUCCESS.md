# Incognito Mode Push Test
**Time:** 2025-01-27 - Incognito Mode Test
**Status:** Testing if Chrome extensions were blocking auto-commit

If you see this file in GitHub, the extension conflict was the issue!

## What This Means:
- Bolt's auto-commit works perfectly
- Chrome extension was interfering
- Solution: Use incognito or disable problematic extension

## Next Steps:
1. Identify which extension caused the conflict
2. Either disable it or whitelist bolt.new
3. Continue development with working auto-commit

**SUCCESS! ðŸŽ‰**
