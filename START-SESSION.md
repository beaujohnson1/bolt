# /start-session Command

## Purpose
This command initializes a development session by:
1. Reading current state from CLAUDE.md and TASKMANAGER.md
2. Setting up session tracking
3. Creating a session log for changes
4. Preparing for continuous updates

## Usage
Type `/start-session` to begin a tracked development session

## Session Workflow

### On Session Start:
1. **Load Current State**
   - Read CLAUDE.md for project context
   - Read TASKMANAGER.md for current task status
   - Read PRD.md for requirements reference
   - Identify active sprint and priorities

2. **Create Session Log**
   - Generate timestamp
   - Record session start time
   - Create SESSION_LOG.md for tracking changes
   - Note current task focus from TASKMANAGER.md

3. **Track During Session**
   - Monitor completed tasks
   - Track new discoveries about the codebase
   - Note any architectural decisions
   - Record API integrations or configuration changes
   - Track blockers or issues encountered

4. **Update Continuously**
   - Mark tasks as completed in memory
   - Queue updates for documentation
   - Track time spent on tasks
   - Note any deviations from plan
