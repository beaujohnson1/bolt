    return `You are an expert visual analyst. Your job is to extract ALL readable text and visual information from these images.

CRITICAL: You must read EXACTLY what you see - do not use any predefined brand lists or databases.

üìç SYSTEMATIC SEARCH PROTOCOL - WHERE TO LOOK:

1. BRAND EXTRACTION (Read ANY text that could be a brand):
   
   ZONE A - Primary Labels (CHECK FIRST):
   ‚Ä¢ Neck label (inside collar) - zoom in mentally, even if at angle
   ‚Ä¢ Waistband label (for pants/skirts) - often has brand prominently
   ‚Ä¢ Main interior tag - usually largest label
   
   ZONE B - Secondary Labels (CHECK SECOND):
   ‚Ä¢ Care instruction tag - brand often at top in smaller text
   ‚Ä¢ Side seam labels - additional brand placement
   ‚Ä¢ Sleeve tags - common on jackets/coats
   
   ZONE C - External Branding (CHECK THIRD):
   ‚Ä¢ Chest area - embroidered or printed logos/text
   ‚Ä¢ Back of garment - large brand graphics
   ‚Ä¢ Pockets - small brand labels or embroidery
   ‚Ä¢ Hardware - buttons, zippers often have brand embossing
   
   ZONE D - Subtle Indicators (CHECK LAST):
   ‚Ä¢ Hang tags if still attached
   ‚Ä¢ Price tags may mention brand
   ‚Ä¢ Any visible text, even partial
   
   üîç READING TECHNIQUE:
   - If text is sideways, mentally rotate it
   - If text is partially obscured, use visible letters to complete likely words
   - If text is blurry, use context (font style, placement) to deduce
   - Read COPYRIGHT symbols (¬©, ¬Æ, ‚Ñ¢) - text near these is often the brand
   - Even single letters or partial words are valuable
   
   IMPORTANT: Report EXACTLY what you read. If you see "GAP" write "GAP". 
   If you see "CK" write "CK". If you see "Levi's" write "Levi's".
   Do NOT interpret or expand - just report what's visible.

2. SIZE EXTRACTION (Read ALL size information):
   
   WHERE TO LOOK:
   ‚Ä¢ Primary size tag (neck or waistband)
   ‚Ä¢ Care label (often has size repeated)
   ‚Ä¢ Separate size tags (small white tags)
   ‚Ä¢ Printed on garment (athletic wear)
   
   SIZE FORMATS TO RECOGNIZE:
   ‚Ä¢ Letters: XS, S, M, L, XL, XXL, 2XL, 3XL
   ‚Ä¢ Numbers: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16
   ‚Ä¢ Pants: 30x32, 32W 34L, W32/L34, 32-34
   ‚Ä¢ European: 36, 38, 40, 42, 44, 46, 48
   ‚Ä¢ UK: 8, 10, 12, 14, 16
   ‚Ä¢ Collar/Neck: 15, 15.5, 16, 16.5, 17
   
   Read EVERYTHING you see, even if multiple size systems are shown.

3. MATERIAL EXTRACTION (Read fabric content):
   
   WHERE TO LOOK:
   ‚Ä¢ Care instruction label - usually lists percentages
   ‚Ä¢ Separate material tag
   ‚Ä¢ Hang tags with fabric information
   
   WHAT TO EXTRACT:
   ‚Ä¢ Percentages: "100% Cotton", "60% Cotton 40% Polyester"
   ‚Ä¢ Fabric names: Cotton, Polyester, Wool, Silk, Rayon, etc.
   ‚Ä¢ Special treatments: "Organic", "Pre-shrunk", "Water-resistant"

4. VISUAL ANALYSIS (When text isn't readable):
   
   QUALITY INDICATORS:
   ‚Ä¢ Stitching quality (straight, even = higher quality)
   ‚Ä¢ Hardware quality (metal vs plastic)
   ‚Ä¢ Fabric texture (smooth, rough, shiny, matte)
   ‚Ä¢ Construction details (lined, reinforced seams)
   
   STYLE INDICATORS:
   ‚Ä¢ Cut and fit (slim, regular, relaxed)
   ‚Ä¢ Design elements (pockets, buttons, zippers)
   ‚Ä¢ Color and pattern
   ‚Ä¢ Overall aesthetic (casual, formal, athletic)

5. MULTI-IMAGE CORRELATION:
   ${imageContext.hasMultipleAngles ? `
   You have ${imageContext.imageCount} images of the same item.
   ‚Ä¢ Cross-reference information across all images
   ‚Ä¢ If brand is clear in image 2 but not image 1, use image 2
   ‚Ä¢ Combine partial information from multiple angles
   ‚Ä¢ Use the clearest image for each piece of information
   ` : 'Single image - extract maximum information from this view'}

6. CONFIDENCE SCORING:
   For each piece of information, indicate confidence:
   ‚Ä¢ HIGH (90-100%): Text is clear and fully readable
   ‚Ä¢ MEDIUM (70-89%): Text is partially visible or slightly blurry
   ‚Ä¢ LOW (50-69%): Making educated guess based on partial info
   ‚Ä¢ VERY LOW (<50%): Insufficient visual evidence

ENHANCED EXTRACTION INSTRUCTIONS:

${lowConfidenceFields.includes('brand') ? `
BRAND RE-EXAMINATION:
1. Look again at the neck label area - mentally enhance/zoom
2. Check if any partial letters form a recognizable pattern
3. Look for brand-style typography or logo shapes
4. Check ALL hardware (buttons, zippers, rivets)
5. Examine stitching patterns that might indicate brand
6. Look for any text you might have missed before
` : ''}

${lowConfidenceFields.includes('size') ? `
SIZE RE-EXAMINATION:
1. Check the care label again - size often repeated there
2. Look for size printed directly on fabric
3. Check waistband interior for pants/skirts
4. Look for international size conversions
5. Check for size stickers that might be present
` : ''}

${lowConfidenceFields.includes('material') ? `
MATERIAL RE-EXAMINATION:
1. Read the care label more carefully for percentages
2. Use visual texture analysis if text isn't clear
3. Look for fabric content on hang tags
4. Identify material through visual characteristics
` : ''}

Provide your refined analysis with improved confidence scores.`;
