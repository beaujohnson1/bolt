# üö® URGENT: eBay OAuth Fix Required

## THE PROBLEM IDENTIFIED

Your eBay Developer Console is configured to redirect to:
```
https://easyflip.ai/app/api/ebay/callback-fixed
```

But this URL **DOES NOT EXIST** in your Netlify deployment!

Your actual working callback handler is at:
```
https://easyflip.ai/.netlify/functions/auth-ebay-callback
```

## IMMEDIATE FIX REQUIRED

### Option 1: Update eBay Developer Console (RECOMMENDED)
1. Go to https://developer.ebay.com/my/keys
2. Click on your app: `easyflip-easyflip-PRD`
3. Find "Your auth accepted URL"
4. **CHANGE IT FROM:**
   ```
   https://easyflip.ai/app/api/ebay/callback-fixed
   ```
   **TO:**
   ```
   https://easyflip.ai/.netlify/functions/auth-ebay-callback
   ```
5. Save the changes
6. Wait 2-3 minutes for eBay to update
7. Try connecting again

### Option 2: Create a Redirect (Quick Workaround)
If you can't change the eBay settings immediately, we can create a redirect in Netlify:

1. Go to Netlify Dashboard
2. Navigate to **Site settings** ‚Üí **Redirects**
3. Add this redirect rule:
   ```
   /app/api/ebay/callback-fixed/* https://easyflip.ai/.netlify/functions/auth-ebay-callback 200!
   ```

## Why This Is Happening

1. **Documentation Confusion**: Multiple conflicting URLs in documentation
2. **Next.js vs Netlify**: The `/app/api/` path is for Next.js apps, but you're using Netlify Functions
3. **eBay Configuration**: eBay is redirecting to the wrong URL after authorization

## Current Flow (BROKEN):
1. User authorizes on eBay ‚úÖ
2. eBay redirects to `/app/api/ebay/callback-fixed` ‚ùå (404 - doesn't exist)
3. No token exchange happens ‚ùå
4. Frontend keeps polling but never finds tokens ‚ùå

## Fixed Flow (WORKING):
1. User authorizes on eBay ‚úÖ
2. eBay redirects to `/.netlify/functions/auth-ebay-callback` ‚úÖ
3. Token exchange happens ‚úÖ
4. Tokens are stored in localStorage ‚úÖ
5. Frontend detects tokens and completes flow ‚úÖ

## Verification

After making the change, verify in browser DevTools Network tab:
- The redirect after eBay authorization should go to `/.netlify/functions/auth-ebay-callback`
- You should see a 200 response with HTML content
- The page should store tokens and close/redirect

## Environment Variables Check

Your Netlify environment variables look correct. The key ones are:
- ‚úÖ `VITE_EBAY_CLIENT_ID` - Set
- ‚úÖ `VITE_EBAY_CLIENT_SECRET` - Set
- ‚úÖ `VITE_EBAY_RU_NAME` - Set
- ‚úÖ `EBAY_RU_NAME` - Set

## Test After Fix

1. Clear browser storage:
   ```javascript
   localStorage.clear(); sessionStorage.clear();
   ```
2. Try connecting eBay account again
3. Check console for success messages
4. Verify tokens are stored in localStorage
